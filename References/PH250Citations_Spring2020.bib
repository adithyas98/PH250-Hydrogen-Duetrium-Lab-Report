% Keep entries in alphabetical order by their short-cut label (e.g. Rydberg1890}, just to help you stay organized.
% I recommend that the code for each should be the author's last name and year -- it's easy to remember, and there are only
% a few instances when it might require something else to distinguish two similar entries (e.g. two papers by the same author in the  same year).
% Exceptions are things like reference works that are easier to remember by the name of the reference (e.g. CRCHandbook}

	abstract = {The energies of the n2P1/2,3/2 level series in 39K (9 ⩽ n ⩽ 21) and 85Rb (13 ⩽ n ⩽ 68) have been measured using frequency-doubled cw dye laser radiation, a thermionic detector and a high-precision vacuum-wavemeter. By means of a Rydberg-Ritz fitting procedure accurate quantum defect data and ionization limits are given. The ionization limits are in agreement with the limits derived from energy data of other l-series which have been measured recently with laser spectroscopy techniques.
The compact Rydberg-Ritz formulas can serve as handy secondary wavelength standards with high precision.
A compilation of the most accurate Rydberg-Ritz coefficient of all alkali term series with l ⩽ 3 is presented and the present status of alkali quantum defect data is discussed. This set of data includes also recent measurements of 133Cs n2S1/2 and n2D3/2,5/2 levels and of some low-lying 7Li levels.}
