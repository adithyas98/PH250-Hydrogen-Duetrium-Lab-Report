# Abstract

Using the methods of optical spectroscopy the R infinity and the Deuterium-to-proton mass ratio were measured with high degrees of accuracy. Measurements were made on the Balmer series transition wavelengths of Hydrogen and Deuterium atoms in a specially made Deuterium lamp which contained more than the the natural abundance of Hydrogen's Isotope.
