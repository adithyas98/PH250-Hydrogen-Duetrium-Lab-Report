# Abstract

Using the methods of optical spectroscopy the $R_{\infty}$ and the Deuterium-to-proton mass ratio were measured with high degrees of accuracy. Measurements were made on the Balmer series transition wavelengths of Hydrogen and Deuterium  atoms in a specially made Deuterium lamp which contained more than the the natural abundance of Hydrogen's Isotope. \Rin was measured at $R_{\infty}=10975000 \pm 1000 \text{m}^{-1}$ and Deuterium-to-proton mass ratio,$\frac{m_d}{m_p}$, was measured at $\frac{m_d}{m_p}=2.0 \pm 0.2$ which gives a percent uncertainty of 0.012\% and 0.882\% respectively.
